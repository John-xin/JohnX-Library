EBMesher:
Elem_Status_Tag: 0 - inside the geometry
                 1 - outside
                 2 - on boundary
                 
NgTetGenMesher:
meshkit: output vtk file cannot show interior correctly in paraview
gmsh: output vtk file show correctly in paraview
problem: 
1. tet number prompted by meshkit is different from the tet number shown in paraview
2. scale is different for gmsh and meshkit in paraview. difference is around 1000 fold.         

PostBLMesher:
thickness - total height
interval - number of layers
bais - [0,1] finer towards boundary; (1,>>) finer towards bulk
surfaceID/edgeID/NEUMANN - target object for boundary layer
surface id for 3d mesh; edge id for 2d mesh; NEUMANN for set/group

MOAB:
background - physics phenomenon -> PDE -> Discretization -> mesh data structure 
-> PDE solve & data visulization
4 components - mesh interface instance; 
  mesh entities (vertex, edge, tri, etc.);
  sets; group of entities, describing relations between entities 
  tags. attaching named data to individual entity, set, even whole mesh
