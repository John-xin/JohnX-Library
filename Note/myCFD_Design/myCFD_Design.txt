1. interactive meshing process
	- can mesh an edge
	- can add points on the edge by user
	- can save the parameters set on the edge
	- can apply the saved parameter to other edge

2. integrated working environment
	- can manipulate geometry model
	- can manipulate mesh
	- can setup CFD boundary condition
	- can add testpoints
	- can apply saved testpoints to other CFD cases
	- can postprocessing testpoints

3. post-processing
	- can add a value on the legend to distinguish the color at the value strongly
