make all

    Build programs, libraries, documentation, etc. (same as make). 
    
make install

    Install what needs to be installed, copying the files from the packageâ€™s tree to system-wide directories. 
    
make install-strip

    Same as make install, then strip debugging symbols. Some users like to trade space for useful bug reports... 
    
make uninstall

    The opposite of make install: erase the installed files. (This needs to be run from the same build tree that was installed.)

    Erase from the build tree the files built by make all. 

make distclean

    Additionally erase anything ./configure created. 

make check

    Run the test suite, if any.
