using amhello-1.0.tar.gz as an example

~ % tar zxf amhello-1.0.tar.gz
~ % cd amhello-1.0
~/amhello-1.0 % ./configure
…
config.status: creating Makefile
config.status: creating src/Makefile
…
~/amhello-1.0 % make
…
~/amhello-1.0 % make check
…
~/amhello-1.0 % su
Password:
/home/adl/amhello-1.0 # make install
…
/home/adl/amhello-1.0 # exit
~/amhello-1.0 % make installcheck

Explain:

"configure" creates the "Makefiles". In real-world projects, there may be many more, usually one Makefile per directory.

"make" will construct all the programs, libraries, and scripts for the project package. In our example, this compiles the hello program.
The constructed files are in the source tree.

"make check" causes the package’s tests to be run. (not mandatory but suggested)

"make install" by default  will install everything in /usr/local, binaries in /usr/local/bin, libraries in /usr/local/lib.
 
That means copying the programs, libraries, header files, scripts, and other data files from the source directory to their final destination on the system.

"installcheck" - Presently most packages do not have any installcheck tests
